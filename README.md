# OctagonAI
An abstract interpreter and C program analyser in the Octagon abstract domain.

This project was created by Jérôme Boillot, Orégane Desrentes, Siang-Yun Lee, Dewmini Marakkalage for the Formal Verification class (CS-550) of autumn 2020 at EPFL.

# How to execute the project

Please use ocaml version 4.11.0 or later.
We recommend using `opam` for the module management.
Modules `zarith`, `frontc` and `dune` are necessary for this project to run (`opam install zarith frontc dune`)
`make` builds the project.
The first time you build the project with `make` you have to execute the following link command: `ln -s _build/install/default/bin/octagonai main.native` so it is easier to execute the analyser.
Once the project is built, you can analyse a program in the file `program.c` with the command `./main.native program.c`

# Tests

The command `./main.native --tests` runs a series of tests, in particular on abstraction and transfer functions, and the DBM (Difference Bound Matrix, which stores the information on variables for the analysis) manipulation.

### Test of DBM implementation
Tests adding constraints to the DBM and testing if they are satisfied.

### Test of Closure Algorithms
Starts with a DBM with a few constraints, and apply different closure algorithms to them : Shortest path, Strong, tight and Optimised Tight. This is tested with 3 different DBMs of different sizes.

### Test of Abstract Transfers
Tests the state of the DBM after assigning variables with linear combinations of other variables.

### Test of Timing in closure algorithms
Tests the time taken by the 4 algorithms cited above on DBM of size 25, 50, 100 and 200.
